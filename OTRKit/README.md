OTRKit
======

An Objective-C Off-the-Record library for iOS.

Installation
-------

To compile libotr and dependencies for iOS, run the included scripts in this order:

1. `build-libgpg-error.sh`
2. `build-libgcrypt.sh`
3. `build-libotr.sh`

Usage
-------

You might not want to use the wrapper library yet because it is unfinished. You can, however, use the build scripts to compile libotr for your own projects.
